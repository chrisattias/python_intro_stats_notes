Estimate population parameters, calculate uncertainty in population parameter estimates with confidence intervals, and decide whether groups are likely the same with hypothesis tests.  We can use either theoretical or simulation based frequentist methods.\n",

Members are divided into strata based on their value for a confounding variable.  The sample size from each strata is meant to be proportional to entire population.  Stratified sampling ensures sample is representative even with smaller sample sizes.  Simple random sampling needs larger sample sizes to ensure this if there is a confounding variable.  Because a smaller sample size can be used, cost is reduced.\n",
    "    - E.g. Males may be more likely to choose football as their favorite sport.  Divide students into two strata, males and females.  Randomly sample 100 students, but make sure that the sample has the same proportion of males and females as the school district on the whole.  If the school district is 55% female, then randomly select 55 female students from one strata and 45 males students from other strata.\n",
    "3. **Cluster Sampling**---first divide the population into clusters (members within each cluster are heterogeneous, but clusters are similar to each other), then randomly sample a few clusters, then sample *every* member within those clusters.  Clusters are often spatially separated locations.  Cluster sampling can reduce costs involved in traveling to locations to sample members of the population.  Unfortunately cluster sampling increases sampling variance.  This is because, in practice, geographic location acts as a confounding variable and members within clusters are more similar to each other than to other clusters.  Cluster sampling has pros and cons.\n",
    "    - **Multistage Sampling**---same as cluster sampling, but randomly sample from within cluster instead of sampling *every* member\n",
    "    - E.g. we don't have time to visit every school.  We make an assumption that each school (cluster) is similar to each other in regards to proportions of student opinions (which are heterogeneous within each school).

Assume we oversample and include double the members of a certain stratum in the sample.  We could correct for this by dividing their sampling weight by 2 so that each of these observations have a sampling weight of 50.  This sampling weight would be used in another formula when a sample statistic is calculated.  The formula would account for the average statistic for each stratum, the sample weights for each stratum, and the total sample size.\n",

    "- **Big data**--subtype of observational study.  Large datasets that are organically generated. Unlike traditional observational studies with random samples, big data is generated as a by-product of some other activity. Big data takes considerable computer resources to process and is often fed into machine learning algorithms.  Datasets can be generated from:\n",
    "    - Web searches \n",
    "    - Smartphone GPS location\n",
    "    - Text, images, and videos from social media platforms\n",
    "    - Online shopping\n",
    "    - Streaming services\n",
    "    - Airplane flights\n",
    "    - Rideshare services\n",
    "    - Genomic tests\n",
    "    - Utility company data\n",
    "    - Etc.\n",
    "- Big data can be treated in two ways:\n",
    "    1. Population.  Treat the big data set as the entire population.  Sampling and inference is not required.\n",
    "        - E.g. define population as adults who shop on Zappos.  Calculate descriptive statistics.\n",
    "    1. Non-probability sample.  Treat the big data set as a convenience sample of a larger population.  Since this big data set is not a random sample, special approaches like the **Pseudo-Randomization Approach** or the **Calibration Approach** must be taken.  These approaches involve weighting the data using auxiliary probability sample data or logistic regression models.  Methods introduce more assumptions and may not always remove sampling bias.\n",
    "       - E.g. define population as all adults and define sample as those adults who shop on Zappos. Attach another dataset with the some of the same variables.  Use this auxiliary data to weight non-probability dataset.  "

    "## Experimental Study Design\n",
    "There are 4 principles of experimental design:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Control**---control/reduce differences besides the response variable to eliminate potential confounding variables.  NOT the same term as *control groups*.\n",
    "    - E.g. if some patients take a pill with water and other patients don't take a pill, make sure they still drink water.\n",
    "1. **Random Assignment**---randomly assign subjects to treatment groups.  When we can not control confounding variables, random distribution cancels out effects of confounding variable.  Also prevents accidental bias.\n",
    "1. **Replicate**---a sufficiently large sample or repeating the experiment can more accurately estimate effects of explanatory variables\n",
    "1. **Block**---sometimes we think the response variable is influenced by a variable that is NOT the explanatory variable, and that can NOT be controlled for.  We can rely on random assignment and replication.  Or, we can group (block) subjects based on this variable.  Within each block subjects are randomly selected for control and treatment groups.  Blocking ensures that subjects with confounding variable traits are evenly distributed into control and treatment groups.\n",
    "    - Blocking is similar to stratifying in that we create homogeneous groups based on confounding variable \n",
    "    - Stratifying groups by confounding variable during sampling\n",
    "    - Blocking groups by confounding variable during assignment\n",
    "    \n",
    "![](pictures/blocking.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Other terms used in experimental studies:\n",
    "    - **Blinding**---subjects do not know if they are in treatment or control group.  They do not know because they are given a placebo.\n",
    "    - **Placebo**---fake treatment\n",
    "    - **Placebo Effect**---subjects show change when given placebo.  Shows emotions affect health (or reported) health outcome.\n",
    "    - **Double Blind**---subjects AND researchers interacting with subjects do not know if subject belongs to control group or treatment group\n",
    "    - **Triple Blind**---statisticians do not know which groups subjects are in\n",
    "    - **Quadruple Blind**---no one knows WTF is going on!  My kind of study!"

The more times we repeat this experiment, the more likely it is that we'll get an experiment with interesting results (like P(Heads) = 0.75).  If we choose to only analyze this dataset we will draw incorrect conclusions.\n",

We group the proportion of heads by year coin minted (e.g. create 20 groups) and compare differences between groups (190 comparisons).  The more groups we compare, the more likely we are to find a pair with an apparent difference in proportion of heads.  This apparent difference may simply be caused by random chance in sampling variability.\n",

    "- Theoretical probability distributions are defined by either of two functions, the PMF or PDF.  These two functions  give distributions their characteristic shapes and properties.  They are also used to calculated statistics about individual points in the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Probability Mass Function (PMF)**--maps value to probability of observing that value.  Discrete variables use PMF.  Visualized as histogram.  We can look at a single discrete value along the x-axis and the height of the bar tells us the probability of getting that x value.  If we took the sum of all the bars in the histogram it would add up to 1.  This is because probability always sums to 1. \n",
    "    - E.g. geometric distribution, binomial distribution, negative binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, etc.\n",
    "1. **Probability Density Function (PDF)**---maps value to its probability density.  Continuous variables use PDFs.  Visualized with density curve.  Probability *density* is NOT the same as probability.  Probability *density* is how much probability is concentrated near the x value.  The height of the curve is the probability *density* and can actually be over 1!  Meanwhile, if we look at a single continuous value along the x-axis the probability of getting that value is zero!  This has to do with continuous variables having an infinite amount of possible values, which means that the probability of getting any single value is infinitely small.  The probability of observing a value within a specified *range* of values is the area under the curve between those two numbers (the *integral*).  While the probability of an entire histogram *sums* to 1, the probability density of the entire curve *integrates* to 1.  Integration must be used in conjunction with the PDF.  Statistical software often places this feature within another function called the cumulative density function.\n",

The change in x never quite reaches zero (zero is the limit) because if there is no change in x there is no change in y.  Also, we can't divide by zero. The derivative is also described as the instantaneous rate of change. It is the slope at one point in time.   It is the slope of a line tangent to our point on the graph.   One must find the derivative before one can find the integral.\n",

    "- **Z-Score**---also called standard score.  Number of standard deviations the observation falls from the population mean.  These are quantiles.\n",
    "- Z-Score is calculated by taking an observation, subtracting the population mean, then dividing this difference by the population standard deviation\n",
    "- $\\text{Z-Score} = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$\n",
    "- If an observation has a Z-score above 2 or below -2, then it is said to be \"unusual\".  This means there is less than a 5% probability of it occurring.\n",
    "- **Standard Normal Distribution**---when all observations in a normal distribution are converted into their Z-Score (standard score) and their relative frequencies are graphed with a density curve.  Alternatively defined with PDF for normal distribution: N($\\mu$=0, $\\sigma$=1).\n",

    "\n",
    "- The Z-Score (quantile) can be converted to a percentile with the CDF function.  A percentile can converted into a Z-Score (quantile) with the ICDF function.  A standard normal distribution table can also be used if we are a luddite.\n",
    "- We can use CDF at two specified quantiles (e.g. ~ -2 sd and ~ 2 sd in a standard normal distribution) and return percentiles (e.g. 2.5% and 97.5%).  If we subtract the smaller percentile form the larger percentile we calculate the probability within this quantile interval (e.g. 95%).\n",

    "- We can use ICDF at two specified percentiles (e.g. 2.5% and 97.5% in a standard normal distribution) and return quantiles (e.g. ~ -2 sd and ~ +2 sd).  The quantile interval contains a certain percentage of the observations (e.g. 95%).\n",
    "- We can repeat this calculations to find the quantile intervals needed to contain different amounts of observations.  This concept will be key for constructing parametric confidence intervals later on.\n",

    "    - 99% of observations are within +- 2.576 quantiles (Z-Scores)\n",
    "- The image below displays the use of many functions.  Top image is standard normal distribution defined by a PDF, middle images are CDF and SF functions that find percentiles, and bottom images are ICDF and ISF that find quantiles.  We have chosen to display intervals that capture 95% of observations as this is common in inference.\n",

    "- **Inference**---randomly sample population, estimate population parameters, calculate uncertainty in population parameter estimates, and test hypotheses.  Used when we do NOT already know population parameters.\n",
    "- **Frequentist**---school of statistical inference that defines probability as the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we repeated a process an infinite number of times.  Frequentist Inference  never gives probability to a hypothesis. A hypothesis is either True or False. Frequentist inference starts with the ideas of the population parameter, sample statistic, and sampling distributions.  It then builds on these ideas with confidence intervals and hypothesis tests that are tailored to different variables types."

    "- Certain conditions must be met to use statistical methods and return valid results\n",
    "- Sampling must follow the best practices described in the *Statistical Studies* section\n",
    "- Most frequentist inference statistical tests assume *IID* data\n",
    "- **IID**--independent and identically distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Independent**--outcome of one process (observation) doesn't influence the outcome of another process.  Independence is achieved by:\n",
    "    1. Random sampling and/or random assignment of members of the population.  Avoid sampling bias.\n",
    "    1. Sample size less than 10% of the population.  Samples are usually taken *w/out replacement*, meaning we sample a subject once and then take them out of the pool to draw from so that can NOT be chosen twice.  When we reduce this pool by one, it changes the probability of choosing the next subject.  If our sample is large relative to our population it can make a noticeable difference and sampling becomes dependent/conditional.  \n",
    "        - E.g. imagine a population of 2 red marbles and 1 blue marble.  The P(Choosing a Blue) = 1/3.  Hypothetically, we choose a red w/out replacement.  Now P(Choosing a Blue)=1/2.  The probability of one observation is dependent on the previous observations.  However, if we had a million blues marbles and two million red marbles, choosing a red marble would not have made a noticeable difference on the probabilities of the next observation.\n",
    "1. **Identically distributed**--distribution of observations does not shift over time while samples are being collected.  If our variable changes over time, then we'll want to account for time in our analysis.   Also note that when groups are compared, identically distributed does NOT imply that groups must have the same distribution parameters.\n",
    "    1. Discrete variables use distributions such as the binomial.  One parameter of a binomial distribution is probability of success.  The probability of success for an event should not change over the course of the study.  \n",
    "        - E.g. P(rolling a 6) on a fair die should remain 1/6.\n",
    "    1. Continuous variables use distributions such as the normal.  Parameters of a normal distribution are mean and standard deviation.  The population mean and population standard deviation should not change over the course of the study. \n",
    "        - E.g. average height and standard deviation of U.S. males should not change\n",
    "- Lastly, note that there are some statistical tests that do not require IID data and many statistical tests that include additional conditions.  For example:\n",
    "    - Paired means test uses dependent data on purpose\n",
    "    - All parametric tests require a minimum sample size\n",
    "    - The ANOVA test requires variance within each group to be similar"

Compounding this problem, if our p-value is high and so does not reject the null hypothesis this cannot be interpreted as the null being true; rather, we are left with an ‘open verdict’.\"\n",
    "    - We can not fix the concept of null and alternative as they are central to null hypothesis testing.  We could avoid using the null hypothesis altogether by instead basing decisions on confidence intervals or Bayesian statistics.\n",
    "1. Null hypothesis testing is biased towards the null hypothesis.  If our data provides equal evidence for both the null and alternative, then we will not reject the null.  If our data provides some, but not overwhelming evidence for the alternative, we will not reject the null.  It is only when we have overwhelming evidence that we will reject the null.\n",

    "1. With a large enough sample size we will reject the null hypothesis. Larger sample sizes reduce the spread of the sampling distribution allowing us to confidently find smaller differences between the null hypothesis and are observed sample statistic.\n",
    "    - We can improve this by planning sample size in advance using power calculations.  Power calculations rely on the idea of desired and estimated effect size. \n",

    "- **Resampling Simulation**---simulations replicate the sampling process, allowing us to build a simulated sampling distribution\n",
    "- Gained popularity as computers improved (*resample, so hot right now*)  \n",
    "- Resampling simulations return similar results as parametric or non-parametric tests and can be used to build confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests\n",
    "- Resampling simulations allow us to use a wider range of sample statistic like mean, proportion, *median*, etc.\n",
    "- Unlike parametric tests that use the CLT, resampling simulations do not require normal sampling distributions.  Because of this, there is no minimal sample size requirement.  That said, larger samples sizes yield more accurate estimates of a population.\n",
    "- Two useful resampling simulation techniques are:\n",
    "    1. Bootstrapping \n",
    "    1. Randomization (permutation)"

Define theoretical null distribution and resample from that.  Since we define the null we can choose a non-normal distribution.  If we choose a normal distribution I imagine it provides similar, if not worse, results when compared to the classical parametric tests.  We will not give an example of this."

    "- \"Regression\" refers to finding the model that is the \"best fit\" for the data.  The term \"regression\" does not really mean anything mathematically and is more of a historical quirk. \n",
    "- The words *model* and *function* can be used interchangeably\n",
    "- **Function**--equation where 1 or more input(s), x, has only one output, y.  Functions pass vertical line test.\n",
    "- **x**--often, there is a variable(s) whose values are already known or can be easily measured.  We call this variable x.  Sometimes x affects another variable, so we call x the **independent/predictor/explanatory/exogenous/regressor/covariate** variable.\n",
    "- **y**--often, there is a variable whose values are hard to directly measure and/or are important to predict, and we want to know why the values change.  We call this variable y.  If the value of y depends on any other variable it is called a **dependent/response/outcome/endogenous** variable.\n",
    "- Two important big picture concepts to keep in mind during regression modeling are:\n",
    "    1. Regression models are built with sample data or population data.  When sample data is used, frequentist or Bayesian inference helps us understand the likelihood that the model made from sample data is the same as the model that would be made from population data.  Sampling must follow the best practices outlined in the the *Statistical Studies* section and those touched on at the beginning of the *Frequentist Inference* section.\n",
    "    1. For both sample and population data, the concepts of causation vs correlation introduced in the *Statistical Studies* section are relevant.  While we will be predicting y from x, we often can NOT say that a change in y is *caused* by a change in x.  We often can say that the change in y is *correlated* with a change in x.  We could only determine causation if our data comes from an experimental study with random assignment into treatment groups.  Even if we can NOT determine causation, regression modeling is still be very helpful for predictions."

This is possibly (not guaranteed with reading documentation) the same linear model we will create later on.  It includes a \"95% confidence interval for that regression\".  Based on this wording and the narrowness of the light blue shading, I assume this is a 95% confidence interval for the mean of the fitted values."
